🫀 Heart Attack Risk Data Analysis using EDA
This project explores heart attack risk factors using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. Through statistical summaries and visualizations, we gain insights into key variables that impact cardiovascular health.

📂 Project Overview
This EDA project investigates a synthetic heart health dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relationships among risk factors like:

Age
Cholesterol levels
Hypertension
Stress level
Physical activity
Heart rate
Family history

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization
NumPy – Numerical operations

📊 Key EDA Steps
Data Collection
Generated synthetic data simulating heart risk profiles for individuals aged 30–85.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Verified data consistency, formatting, and ensured no missing or duplicate values.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Feature distributions: age, cholesterol, stress, activity, heart rate.

Correlation heatmap to detect relationships.

Age group risk analysis using bar plots.

Risk impact of stress and physical activity using box plots.

📌 Key Findings
Individuals aged 70–80 are at highest risk of heart attacks.

High stress increases risk, while more physical activity reduces it.

Cholesterol and Hypertension are strong indicators of heart attack likelihood.

Family history showed limited impact in this dataset — emphasizing lifestyle factors.

📈 Visuals Included
Histograms & KDE plots
Correlation heatmap
Bar plot (Heart Attack Risk by Age Group)
Box plots (Stress & Physical Activity vs Risk)
